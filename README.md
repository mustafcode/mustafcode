- ðŸ‘‹ Hello World!
- ðŸ‘€ I'm a creative technologist with a passion for creating valuable user experiences at scale.
In a world of increasing complexity and interconnectedness, I utilize systems and design thinking to make sense of the world and find innovative solutions to problems.

I'm a big believer in Scott Adams's Skills Stack idea. Itâ€™s the idea that you can combine ordinary skills until you have the right kind to be extraordinary.

The skill stack I'm building is as follows:

- Design instincts x business principles
- Design instincts x data analysis
- Storytelling x coding
- Storytelling x data analysis
- Business principles x coding
